 Automated Market Maker on Stellar Network (XLM)

**Description:**
The end goal of this project is to provide liquidity to the stellar network while simultaneously make money in the process.

order_book.py will be used to query the most popular liquidity pool to try and beat their exchange rate to increase my own pool's usage.


Installation:

**Roadmap:**
 1) Set up buyer and seller bots on cron schedule within CMC limit of 300 API calls a day
 2) Implement market making algo. Potentially taking advantage of open source [kelp](https://github.com/stellar/kelp)
